Extend Agent with Apex Action
Coral Cloud Resorts front-desk employees need an easy way to check the weather, so that they
can recommend experiences based on the weather forecast. In this exercise, you'll create a
custom action using an Invocable Apex class that allows your agent to invoke a third-party
weather API.
Step 1: Create the Apex class
1. From Setup, search for Apex and click Apex Classes.
2. Click New button and copy-paste the following code to create CheckWeather Apex
class.
public with sharing class CheckWeather {
@InvocableMethod(
label='Check Weather'
description='Check weather at Coral Cloud Resorts at a
specific date. The date must be in the future, not today or
earlier.'
)
public static List<WeatherResponse> getWeather(
List<WeatherRequest> requests
) {
// Retrieve the date for which we want to check the
weather
Datetime dateToCheck = (Datetime)
requests[0].dateToCheck;
// Call a weather service to retrieve the weather
through an API call
WeatherService.Weather weather =
WeatherService.getResortWeather(
dateToCheck
);
// Create the response for the agent
WeatherResponse response = new WeatherResponse();
response.minTemperature = weather.minTemperatureC;
response.maxTemperature = weather.maxTemperatureC;
response.temperatureDescription =
'Temperatures will be between ' +
weather.minTemperatureC +
'Â°C (' +
weather.minTemperatureF +
'Â°F) and ' +
weather.maxTemperatureC +
'Â°C (' +
weather.maxTemperatureF +
'Â°F) at Coral Cloud Resorts.';
return new List<WeatherResponse>{ response };
}
public class WeatherRequest {
@InvocableVariable(
required=true
description='Date for which we want to check the
temperature. The variable needs to be an Apex Date type with
format yyyy-MM-dd.'
)
public Date dateToCheck;
}
public class WeatherResponse {
@InvocableVariable(
description='Minimum temperature in Celsius at Coral
Cloud Resorts location for the provided date'
)
public Decimal minTemperature;
@InvocableVariable(
description='Maximum temperature in Celsius at Coral
Cloud Resorts location for the provided date'
)
public Decimal maxTemperature;
@InvocableVariable(
description='Description of temperatures at Coral
Cloud Resorts location for the provided date'
)
public String temperatureDescription;
}
}
The getWeather() method is defined as an @InvocableMethod so it can be invoked by
your agent. The method returns a WeatherResponse object. The attributes of the
WeatherResponse class are defined as @InvocableVariable. The descriptions in both
@InvocableMethod and @InvocableVariable are important because they allow your
agent to understand how to use the action.
3. Click Save.
